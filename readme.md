### Pawspital

This is uOttawa GNG 5300 Full Stack Development course final project. The original project repository is https://github.com/pouriamrt/Pet_eHospital_FullStackApp. This is the second version of Pawspital. I used React to reconstructed the frontend page, achieving front-end and back-end separation. The new version has not been finished yet, it's in an ongoing basis.
**To Run this project:**

```shell
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. flask run
```
